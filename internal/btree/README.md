# Description 

Implementation of a Btree in golang 

# Status 

Implemented inserts and search. 

Performance is equal to "github.com/google/btree" so I did not look into more optimizations... yet. 

Did also consider implementing:
1. Delete 
2. Visitor pattern 
3. Consider other Btree apis for inspiration of other operations. 

See the tests for how to use this.
